# hello-world

Hi everyone!!!

I really love to do data analyses by writing codes though I'm a newbie in programming.
I joined github to learn the codes, & to make queries.

## Fun fact about me
so much satisfying to see the outputs on the screen at the end of the codes,
  but painful when the software returns error messages.

## Hobbies
1. playing around with codes
2. going shopping

## Extremely good at
treasure-hunting at sales :P
